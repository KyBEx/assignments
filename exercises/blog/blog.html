                    <p>Nothing can stop the legendary goddess of everything Grace Jones from demonstrating her top-tier pose
                        game and slathering a red carpet with her glamour. I mean, a cunty Emo hedge attacked Grace Jones’
                        head last night, and not even that kept her down.
                        <blockquote>
                            A must-see highly educational film on how we should all live our lives (aka the Grace Jones documentary Grace Jones: Bloodlight
                            and Bami) premiered in London last night, and the empress herself glided onto the carpet in a
                            headpiece that looks like it came from Hot Topic’s capsule collection for Armstrong Garden Center
                            (Hot Topic x Armstrong Garden Center). It was really made by Philip Treacy. There’s that saying,
                            “Bitch could wear a potato sack and still look hot.” Well, Grace Jones can wear Home Depot’s
                            entire shrubbery section on her head and still look hotter than hot.
                            <br> I would never advise us peons to try to work a look that Grace Jones has already worked to perfection,
                            but well, if you’re invited to a glamorous funeral and a duck hunting expedition on the same
                            day, this may be the look for you!

                    <p id="author">October 25, 2017 / Posted by: C.J.</p>

                    <p>When I read that Mariah Carey performed a few numbers at a private party for Karl Lagerfeld on Monday
                        night, I started seal clapping in glee at the thought of those two just taking separate corners of
                        the Boom Boom Room to see who could give the most ‘tude in this self-absorbed Price Is Right Showcase
                        Showdown. Who won round 1? Mimi, dahhhhhling!
                        <br>
                        <br> Page Six says Mariah was brought on board to make a private dinner for Karl into dinner theater
                        by singing a few hits to a room that included Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, Naomi Campbell, Mario Testino,
                        and Baz Luhrmann. While it is entirely plausible all of them were skulking over their 2 status in
                        the presence of a real 10 (Karl’s cat, Choupette Lagerfeld, of course), it was Mariah who barked
                        orders at the press:
                        <br>
                        <br> “She asked photographers to move to the left side of the room as she preferred to be shot from the
                        other angle when she performs.”
                        <br>
                        <br> As we know, Mariah perceives one side to be better, which isn’t smart! She’s going to need another
                        Vegas residency to pay for the therapy and ice cream bill for her depressed and neglected other side.
                        What’s even better is she finally found a new minion task for Bryan Tanaka, and that’s serving as
                        the royal photo approver. The source said, “He was looking at each photo and saying ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ ”
                        <br>
                        <br> People also reports Mariah was spotted rocking the $10 million engagement ring that her ex James
                        Packer gave her. James was curiously silent when asked about it, but Mariah set the record straight
                        by flashing the bling, which paired great with her diva does Woodstock weave (see: picture above).
                        <br>
                        <br> That being said, you don’t wanna let the presence of your ex get too much in the way of your newest
                        boyfriend. Odd jobs are a great way to distract a boy toy! I can’t wait for the logical next step,
                        which will be Mariah making Bryan handle the snow machine and shovel the reindeer shit for her 925
                        Days of Christmas concerts!</p>

                <h1 id="postTitle">Lil Wayne Bailed On A Show Because He Didn’t Want To Go Through Security</h1>
                <p id="author">October 3, 2017 / Posted by: Allison</p>
                <img src="http://dlisted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wenn23247880.jpg">
                <p>
                    Lil Wayne has again denied his fans the opportunity to see his lil ass bounce around on stage to “Lollipop.” Except this
                    time, it’s not because of seizures. This time Lil Wayne cancelled a performance simply because he didn’t
                    want to go through the venue’s security checkpoint.
                    <br>
                    <br> UsWeekly says that Wayne was scheduled to perform at the 2nd annual Fall Ball with 2 Chainz, Tory Lanez,
                    and Cardi B on Saturday night at the Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, South Carolina. Like many public
                    events and concerts, there was a mandatory security check (you know, where they check your purse and
                    pray they don’t find the joints you rolled into tampon wrappers). Performers also have to go through
                    the checkpoint and Lil Wayne wasn’t feeling it, so he refused to do it, and didn’t go on.
                    <br>
                    <br> Naturally, there were people who wanted their money back. Promoters sent a letter to the Colonial Life
                    Arena informing them that they had declined to offer refunds because Lil Wayne wasn’t the headliner (despite
                    the fact that all promo for the show had Lil Wayne’s mug front and center).
