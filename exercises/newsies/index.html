            <h2>Don’t Expect A Pleasant Experience With Jennifer Lawrence If You Approach Her In Public</h2>

                    Are you the type of person who gets excited enough to approach a celebrity in public? Then the following message is for you. If you see <strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong>, do not approach. Do not make eye contact. Do not shout out <em>“Hey Hunger Games!”</em> from across the street unless you want a heavy dose of RUDE.
                    <br><br>
                    In the same conversation with <strong>Adam Sandler</strong> for Variety’s Actors on Actors series, JLaw asks Adam about his biggest fan encounter. Adam says he gets approached every day, which is a huge duh, because who wouldn’t be thrilled to meet Opera Man? Adam says he gets a lot of people pulling up chairs at dinner with him. Jennifer Lawrence, on the other hand, doesn’t have that problem.

                    Jennifer hates fan interaction, so she’s devised a clever plan to keep fans as far away as possible when she’s in public: she acts like an asshole to them. Jennifer Lawrence intentionally rude to a stranger? Shocking.
                    <br>
                    <blockquote class="quote">
                        “Once I enter a public place, I become incredibly rude. I turn into a huge asshole. That’s kind of like my only way of defending myself, is just being like, an asshole. Like, see somebody walking towards my table, and just go [wags finger no], or like ‘Can I have a selfie?’ and I’m like ‘No!’ That’s like my only defense.”
                    </blockquote>

            <div class= "column"></div>
            <p>                    <br>                
                
                    Jennifer doesn’t always act like a snobby shit to her fans. Sometimes Jennifer is in a kind mood and lets them down gently by informing them that she’s not taking pictures because it’s her day off. There are has-beens out there who are so jealous of Jennifer Lawrence right now, like <em>“Aw, I wish I was still at the point in my career where I could turn away fans.”</em>
                    <br><br>                    
                    But she doesn’t always have to be an asshole. She spends a lot of time in New York, and there’s nothing city dwellers fear more than a possible insect infestation. If Jennifer Lawrence really wants to avoid people, she just has to tape a crudely-drawn sign to her chest that reads “BED BUGS” before she leaves the house. I can guarantee she’ll never be approached again.
